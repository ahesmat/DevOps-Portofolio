EC2 Jenkins Deployment Steps:
1- Run bootstrap.sh: 
    This script will:
       Install Terraform and AWS CLI on your machine.
       Initialize Terraform by running terraform init.

2- Run configure-aws.sh:
    This script will:
       Take the AWS Access Key ID as the first argument and the AWS Secret Access Key as the second argument.
       Configure the AWS CLI with these credentials, allowing it to communicate with your AWS account.

3- Run provision-EC2-Instance.sh:
    This script will:
      Provision an EC2 instance using Terraform.
      Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance.
      Print the Jenkins URL and first-time admin password to the standard output.

4- Run destroy-hardware.sh:
    This script will:
       Destroy the EC2 instance and clean up the resources provisioned by Terraform.
  
5- login-to-created-instance.sh:
    This is a temporary script that will be generated after the EC2 instance is created.
     It will be used to log into the instance but will be automatically deleted once the instance is destroyed.
    This script is added to .gitignore to ensure it is not pushed to the remote repository.
